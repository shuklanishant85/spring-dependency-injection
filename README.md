    * via xml based bean handling
    * via configuration based bean handling
    * via annotation based bean handling
    * via Google Guice API.
2. The code suggest implementing a messaging service using these spring methodologies
3. The code will be updated with a complete functional implementation soon.
4. The repository also contains NOTES to make the reader understand the concepts clearly.\
  The following files contain the detailed concepts:
